# udemy-git-github-course-exercises
This is a repository that I created to be able to practice the exercises of the Udemy course [GIT+GitHub: Todo un sistema de control de versiones de cero](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-github).

This repository corresponds to a personal exercise and is not linked in any way to the course or the author of the course.

The `HELP.md` file contains a list of all the commands taught in the course.

The `demo-01-initializr` folder contains a web page created with [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com).
